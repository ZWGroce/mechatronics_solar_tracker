t_left = A0
t_right = A1
b_left = A2
b_right = A3

tleft = value from A0
tright = value from A1
bleft = value from A2
bright = value from A3

top = (tleft + tright)/2
bottom = (bleft + bright)/2
left = (tleft + bleft)/2
right = (tright + bright)/2

if top > bottom:
	move up, else move down or don't move
if left > right:
	move left, else move right or don't move

Probably incorporate a filter to smooth out data from sensors
Probably also a good idea to incorporate a buffer for the "don't move" region so it isn't twitchy
